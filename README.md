# soyfall [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/kevmannn/soyfall/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/kevmannn/soyfall)

[A React / Redux app to monitor daily rainfall in soybean-saturated locales](https://soyfall.now.sh)

## The problem (and a solution):
> Create a service that shows today's total rainfall for counties that produce a lot of soybeans. The user can choose a state to filter the results.

The challenge is meaningfully interpreting the problem in the light of ostensible utility that its solution can provide.
Given the constraints of the problem, it was therefore necessary to think in terms of extensibility from the beginning.

## Challenges & Tradeoffs:
### Opting for a new (simpler) way of showing (meaningful) context
> ...

### Trying not to represent too much data at a given moment
> ...

### Chasing down bugs related to working with cached state
> ...

### Not letting focus on implementation quietly overrule purpose
> ...

### Imagining what would bring the most utility to an agriculturally-minded user

## Lessons:
* Willingness to close the laptop and just think should be commensurate with obscurity concerning the "large-scale path" of the solution.

* The interpretation of the problem will fluctuate, and given its extreme importance (with respect to how all subsequent thinking takes shape) thus demands attention to how it is "heard".

* Much thinking can be contingent on (apparent) API limitations and assumptions about their response formats.

## Future (in order of priority):
* Better test coverage.

* Use [Redux-pack](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/redux-pack) or [Redux-loop](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop) to bring increased neatness / extensibility / sanity to async actions.

* Overlay historical average rainfall for a given timespan onto the chart.

* Correlate the forecast with boon / doom of the crop (given the nature of soybean and the crop's history / growth stage (which should also be accomodated in the app)).

* Generalize to support other crop types.

* For the sake of triage, use the mapbox API to show shortest paths (and directions) between farm locations the user cares about.

* Account for the fact of weather forecasting (possibly) being [PSPACE-hard](http://www.sigecom.org/exchanges/volume_7/3/FORTNOW.pdf).
